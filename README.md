# User Registration and Login System

## Introduction
This Java program implements a simple user registration and login system using Swing for the graphical interface. Users can register with a username and password, which must meet certain requirements, and then log in with those credentials.

## Features
- User Registration: Users can register by providing their name, surname, username, and password. Username must be 5 characters long and contain an underscore. Password must be at least 8 characters long, contain at least one capital letter, one number, and one special character.
- User Login: Registered users can log in using their username and password.
- Input Validation: User inputs are validated to ensure they meet the specified criteria.
- Graphical User Interface: The program utilizes Swing to provide a user-friendly interface for registration and login.

## Usage
1. Run the program.
2. Choose an option from the menu:
    - **Register**: Allows users to register by providing their details.
    - **Login**: Allows registered users to log in using their username and password.
    - **Exit**: Terminates the program.
3. If registering:
    - Enter your name, surname, username, and password.
    - Ensure that username and password meet the specified criteria.
4. If logging in:
    - Enter your username and password.
    - If the credentials are correct, you will be logged in; otherwise, an error message will be displayed.
5. After successful registration or login, follow the prompts to proceed.

## Notes
- This program is a basic implementation and may lack advanced features like database storage or encryption for passwords. It serves as a demonstration of basic user authentication concepts.
- Feel free to modify and extend the program according to your needs and requirements.
